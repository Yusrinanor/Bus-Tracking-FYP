# Bus-Tracking-FYP
Fulfilling `final year project` from APU

## About Project
The developer proposed a mobile application for APU’s shuttle bus services to improve its current system by integrating the current system’s features and create a dedicated platform for the service, making it easier for students to access features related to campus shuttle. With this mobile application, students can access different types of information from bus schedules to current location of the buses, increasing information accuracy. Furthermore, bus drivers would be encouraged to depart and arrive on time as per schedule as their current location while conducting trips to and from the campus would be tracked. Based on this data, the admin would be able to view bus arrival reports, enabling the performance of the service to be monitored, thus, increasing service quality and possibly, increasing students’ satisfaction towards the service.

## Deliverables
The proposed application will have 3 types of users each with a specific set of functionalities and features:

- Students (main users):
1) Log in with student ID to access its features
2) View respective bus schedules (LRT, Endah Promenade, Vista, etc.)
3) Track shuttle bus to and from campus/accommodation
4) Receive push notifications upon bus arrival
5) Students can give feedback regarding the service if they face any issues

- Bus Drivers:
1) Log in with their registered ID (e.g. employee ID).
2) Track their journey based on assigned routes/location
3) View bus schedule based on assigned routes/location
4) Drivers can give feedback regarding the service if they face any issues

- System Administrator:
1) Log in with their registered ID
2) Add new bus timing to schedule
3) Delete bus timing from schedule
4) View students’ and drivers’ feedback
5) Enable report creation
